# MyPortfolio

**The goal of this project was to create a personalized profolio with boostrap to be used at a later time.  

**Has a fully functional nav bar with a collapsing hamburger menu for mobile devices.  When size of the page is decreased, the hamburger menu will become functional.
**Has contact page which will currently send emails to me through a third party email app (will be updated later). 
**All links work.
**HTML sematics were used to create easy read for other developers. 
**This portfolio also utilizes the use of boostrap grid system.
**Personal images will be added at a later time.
