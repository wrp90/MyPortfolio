## Portfolio

 
## Description
* The goal of this project was to create a personalized profolio with boostrap to be used at a later time.  
* Has a fully functional nav bar with a collapsing hamburger menu for mobile devices.  When size of the page is decreased, the  hamburger menu will become functional.
* Has contact page which will currently send emails to me through a third party email app (will be updated later). 
* HTML sematics were used to create easy read for other developers. 
* This portfolio also utilizes the use of boostrap grid system.
